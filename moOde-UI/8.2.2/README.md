Modified moOde source files to integrate moOde-mountstatus feature to system configuration in moOde UI.

moOde-mounstatus feature will disable moOde's basic LED management.

Backup original moOde source files before replacing them.

Replace file "worker.php" in "/var/www/daemon".
Replace file "sys-config.php" in "/var/www".
Replace file "sys-config.html" in "/var/www/templates".
